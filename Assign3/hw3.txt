Q1: 
Why did Brady's patch remove the line "case_long_iso_time_style:"? 
Was it necessary to remove that line? Explain.

Brady's patch removes the label "case_long_iso_time_style" 
because the goto statement is deleted.
This label will no longer be called. 
However, it's existence does not affect the program.

Q2:
If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils 
instead of the default one, 
what else should you watch out for? 
Might this new version of Coreutils introduce 
other problems with your application, 
perhaps in countries where users don't speak English and 
don't understand English-format dates?

Some locales that do not have the translation will display
only English and non-English speakers will not understand. 

Q3:
What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, 
and why?

If the randline.py script invoked on an empty file, 
the following errors are generated:

  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This is because the empty file "contains" no line and 
trying to read a line from it generates undefined behavior.

Q4:
What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, 
and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by 
using the command python3 instead of python.)

When trying to run readline.py under python3, 
the following error message is generated:

  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because in python3, IOError is merged into OSError, 
so the corresponding argument changed.
